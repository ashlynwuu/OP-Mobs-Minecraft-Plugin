# OP-Mobs-Minecraft-Plugin
A Minecraft Java plugin that can be used in Minecraft 1.14.4, causing all mobs to spawn overpowered.

This plugin was heavily inspired by a Minecraft Youtuber, Dream.
A link to his channel can be found below.
I added on a few new characteristics to his plugin, such as giving zombies a diamond sword enchanted with sharpness II.

To run this plugin, create a server on Aternos to run!
